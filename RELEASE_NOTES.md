# Elevator v3.1.3 Release Notes

## Fixes
- Fixed a startup crash in Minecraft 1.21+ caused by particle name changes (SPELL_WITCH -> WITCH).
- Added fault tolerance for configuration loading, automatically compatible with outdated particle names in old configurations, eliminating the need for manual config updates.
